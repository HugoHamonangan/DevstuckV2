          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are terms that
          are often used interchangeably in the tech world, but they represent
          different concepts. While AI refers to the broad idea of machines
          being able to perform tasks that would normally require human
          intelligence, machine learning is a subset of AI focused on algorithms
          that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time.

          What is Artificial Intelligence?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-4 leading-8">
          Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to
          create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require
          human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, perception,
          and language understanding. AI systems are designed to mimic human
          cognitive functions, which allows them to carry out a variety of
          tasks, from simple ones like recognizing faces in photos to complex
          decision-making processes.

          What is Machine Learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-4 leading-8">
          Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of
          algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve
          their performance on tasks through experience. Rather than being
          explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model is
          trained on data, which allows it to make predictions or decisions
          without human intervention.

          Types of Machine Learning
        </h3>
        <ul class="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-4 leading-8">
          <li>
            Supervised learning: The model is trained on labeled data, and the
            algorithm makes predictions based on that data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsupervised learning: The model finds patterns or relationships in
            data without labels or predefined outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reinforcement learning: The model learns through trial and error,
            receiving feedback to improve its performance.

          Key Differences Between AI and Machine Learning
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-400 mb-4 leading-8">
          While AI and machine learning are closely related, they are not the
          same. AI encompasses a broad range of technologies and methods aimed
          at mimicking human intelligence, whereas machine learning is
          specifically focused on creating systems that can learn from data.
          Below are some of the main differences:

            AI is the broader concept that refers to machines being able to

            method used to achieve AI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Machine learning requires data and algorithms to learn and make
            decisions, while AI might use additional methods such as
            knowledge-based systems and expert systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Machine learning models often improve automatically as they receive
            more data, whereas AI systems might rely on predefined rules and
            heuristics.
